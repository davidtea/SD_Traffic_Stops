On a broader scale, given that the population of San Diego is increasing, it reasonable to say that the number of traffic violations is also increasing at a similar rate. We can also guess that the number of vehicle stops in more populated areas is greater than those in less populated areas."

Previous reports on vehicle stops found on the San Diego County's government website focus on apparent racial bias among the San Diego Police Department. Unlike these reports, we would like to take our analyses in a different direction and see if there are other external factors that influence the frequency of vehicle stops.\n",

There have been studies within other professions that show how the time of day affects job performance. For instance, judges tend to rule more harshly right before lunchtime.

    "*Data Cleaning (2-3 sentences)*\n",
    "The vehicle stops data is fairly clean, but we will need to remove the \"obtained_consent\", \"contraband_found\", and \"property_seized\" columns since the majority of the datapoints do not contain values for these parameters. Also, we would need to remove rows that are missing data from the other columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)*\n",
    "We will analyze the data by creating a few python dictionaries. We will first create a dictionary to keep track of the number of vehicle stops within each month, and then create another dictionary to keep track of the number of vehicle stops hourly over the course of the day based on the timestamps. We may also find some way to look up the day of the week associated with each date and see if there are trends in vehicle stops across the week. In addition to seeing trends across San Diego county, we will also see if there are any trends within each subregion of San Diego. The vehicle stops data includes the police service area code for each stop, so we can create a dictionary entry for each service area code, and then add generate a total number of stops in each area.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also try to predict future trends in vehicle stops by creating a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What to report (2-3 sentences)*\n",
    "We will create line graphs to show the trend in vehicle stops over the course of the months. We can create histograms to show the trend over the week and throughout the day. For the regional analysis, we can make a heatmap to show the frequency of stops within each region.\n",

    "\n",
    "As previous reports on San Diego vehicle stops have mentioned, the data provided by the San Diego Police Department is incomplete and does not contain all of the information related to each and every vehicle stop. Also, the SDPD includes the data of non-resident vehicle stops, which would not reflect the changes in population within San Diego county. Additionally, as previous reports have stated, there is a racial bias towards minorities among the SDPD, so there may be more police stops in areas with more minorities, which would skew our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our methods do not work, then we will reevaluate our data and see if there is a way to remove the biases, or at the very least isolate them. For instance, we can see if there is any significant difference between including the non-resident vehicle stop data and not including it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another confound that we came across after taking a quick glance at our data is that the number of vehicle stops is actually decreasing over the years, from 144164 stops in 2014 to 103052 in 2016. This trend already disproves our hypothesis that vehicle stops are increasing in San Diego. We will need to do further research and find possible reasons that explain this decline. "
