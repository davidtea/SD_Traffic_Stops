# SD_Traffic_Stops

### Group project for COGS108
#### Members:
* Louise Xu
* Jeffrey Lu
* David Tea

##### Goal of Project:
The goal of our project is to determine whether there is a correlation between the frequency of vehicle stops in San Diego and the time and locations at which they take place. Additionally, we want to see if there are correlations between the location of a vehicle stop and the time at which it took place. If any correlations do exist, we would like to examine possible logistical, psychological, or social reasons for these correlations.

#### Here is a heatmap generated from the data in the notebook:
